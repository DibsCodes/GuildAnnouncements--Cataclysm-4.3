# GuildAnnouncements--Cataclysm-4.3
 A World of Warcraft Addon for Cataclysm 4.3.4

GM or officer of a guild and tired of answering the same questions over and over? Try Dibs_GuildAnnouncements. It'll send messages to the guild chat window every so often reminding players in the guild of rules, where to sign up for raids, discord info, guild bank info, and whatever else you'd like to add. You can customize all of the messages and set the interval between them to any amount.

Type /ga to configure
